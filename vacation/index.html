					<li>Top 3 reasons to go to Oahu</li>
					<li>1. Sunny weather
                        Unlike other parts of the United States, it is sunny and warm almost all year round. The vegetation on the island is still lush and green, and the waterfalls are flowing. You can not only enjoy sunbathing, but also swim and surf!</li>
					<li>2. There won't be too many people - feel at ease
                        A very important reason is that you can truly enjoy the leisure time on vacation and enjoy a slow life.</li>
                     <li>3. Unique tropical rainforest scenery
                        The most beautiful thing about Hawaii is that in addition to its countless beaches and endless coastline, it also has unique tropical rainforest scenery. After admiring the endless coastline, the lush green will surprise you as if you were a child discovering a treasure.</li>
