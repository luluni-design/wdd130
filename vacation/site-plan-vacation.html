      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Promote travel company products, add more partners, maintain effective communication with customers and sell travel packages directly through the website platform.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People of all ages who love nature and travel.Company employees and our partners</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <a class='website' href="https://luluni-design.github.io/wdd130/vacation/index.html">Website</a>

      <h3>Goals </h3>
      <p>I have lived here for 6 years. Some of the photos were taken by me myself. I want to use a local's perspective to recommend things worth doing and eating to everyone. I hope more people to know about Hawaii. Its beauty should not only exist in the eyes of locals.</p>
      
      <h3>Design Process </h3>
      <p>My design is mainly pictures, supplemented by text. I originally wanted to have a maximum of two pictures for one website, but the scenery in Hawaii is so beautiful. I collected a lot of pictures and wanted to include every one of them. I think words alone are difficult to impress people. So I think the last food website should be presented in the form of a slideshow.</p>
     
      <h3>Conclusion </h3>
      <p>Through this course, I learned simple web design and how to learn independently. It will take quite a long time to research and learn in depth. I hope to use this skill in web programming to help my family or friends create some simple websites in the future. I also hope to find a related job in the future through in-depth study.</p>

        Aloha and welcome to the Oahu!  The warm days, peaceful nights and plumeria-scented breezes make Hawaii one of the most pleasant places in the world to visit.
        Sometimes called “The Gathering Place,” Oahu certainly lives up to its name. The third largest Hawaiian island is home to the majority of Hawaii's diverse population, a fusion of East and West cultures rooted in the values and traditions of the Native Hawaiian people.
        It's this fundamental contrast between the ancient and the modern that makes discovering Oahu — from bustling city life to laidback surf towns — so enjoyable. You'll find plenty of different options for exploring Oahu's different regions, the island's many activities, its eclectic restaurants and accommodations. Experience Hawaii through the eyes of a local private guide! Browse our tour 'suggestions' - each can be customized just for you. Discover the island's hidden gems, local stories, natural wonders and cultural hotspots on a private Hawaii tour. Our Hawaii guides will ensure you receive a warm welcome wherever you go! Let's go!
        Top 3 reasons to go to Oahu
        The clear blue water and white sandy beach that catch your eye really made you feel like you are in paradise.
        1. Sunny weather
        Unlike other parts of the United States, it is sunny and warm almost all year round. The vegetation on the island is still lush and green, and the waterfalls are flowing. You can not only enjoy sunbathing, but also swim and surf!
        2. There won't be too many people - feel at ease
        A very important reason is that you can truly enjoy the leisure time on vacation and enjoy a slow life.
        3. Unique tropical rainforest scenery
        The most beautiful thing about Hawaii is that in addition to its countless beaches and endless coastline, it also has unique tropical rainforest scenery. After admiring the endless coastline, the lush green will surprise you as if you were a child discovering a treasure.
