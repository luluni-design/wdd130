       <p>Hello everyone! </p>
       <p>My name is Lulu Ni. I'm glad to see you here. I am from China. I have two boys. Currently I live in Hawaii. I have a rabbit, a cat and a dog. In my free time, I enjoy taking my two boys and my dog to the beach. I chose computer science because I wanted to find a remote job in the future. So that I can spend more time with my family.</p>     
       <p>I am grateful that our church gave me this opportunity to continue my education. Prayer can help resolve difficulties. I wish everyone has the courage to overcome difficulties.</p>
